# Evaluation â€¢ Chapter 7

### Question 1: Write a recursive function to compute the number of leaves of a tree.



### Question 2: Write a recursive function to compute the number of branches of a tree.


### Question 3: Write a recursive function to compute the most number of children spanning from one branch of a tree.


### Question 4: How would you use strstr to see if a node was tagged as an expr?


### Question 5: How would you use strcmp to see if a node had the contents '(' or ')'?


### Question 6: Add the operator %, which returns the remainder of division. For example % 10 6 is 4


### Question 7: Add the operator ^, which raises one number to another. For example ^ 4 2 is 16.


### Question 8: Add the function min, which returns the smallest number. For example min 1 5 3 is 1.


### Question 9: Add the function max, which returns the biggest number. For example max 1 5 3 is 5.



### Question 10: Change the minus operator - so that when it receives one argument it negates it.
