# Basics â€¢ Chapter 3

### First question: Use a for loop to print out Hello World! five times.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    {
        printf("Hello, World\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Question 2: Use a while loop to print out Hello World! five times.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int i = 5;
    while (i > 0)
    {
        printf("Hello, World\n");
        i--;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Question 3: Declare a function that outputs Hello World! n number of times. Call this from main.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void pHello(int n)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        printf("Hello, World\n");
    }
}
int main()
{
    pHello(5);
    return 0;
}
```
