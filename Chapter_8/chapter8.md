### Question 1: Run the previous chapter's code through gdb and crash it. See what happens.


### Question 2: How do you give an enum a name?


### Question 3: What are union data types and how do they work?

A union is a composite data type in C and C++ that allows you to store different data types in the same memory location. Unlike structures (struct), where each member has its memory space, a union allocates memory for only one member at a time. This means that a union's size is determined by its largest member.

### Question 4: What are the advantages over using a union instead of struct?


### Question 5: Can you use a union in the definition of lval?

yes

### Question 6: Extend parsing and evaluation to support the remainder operator %.


### Question 7: Extend parsing and evaluation to support decimal types using a double field.
